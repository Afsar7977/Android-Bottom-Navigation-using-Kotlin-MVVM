# eCommerce-Android-App-Kotlin

A eCommerce App built using Room, Retrofit, Coroutines, along with ViewModel for Data Transactions between the UI.

Using Bottom Navigation created a application which consists of Product Listing using Retrofit, Details Page,
Search Functionality and User Profile using Room Persistence Library.

For Retrofit Network API i've tried injecting Coroutines using ViewModel (first-time).
Please try to gauge into this project and let me know if any issues found / occurred while building it.
